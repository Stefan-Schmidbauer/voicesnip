**Note**:

- Available models are predefined in VoiceSnip and shown in the GUI dropdown menu. Select your preferred model and it will be saved for future sessions.
- VoiceSnip supports the listed Deepgram models.

## Requirements

VoiceSnip requires X11 display server for desktop integration (xclip, xdotool, xprop). Wayland is not supported at the moment.

## Installation

**Note**: The automated installation script (`install.py`) is designed for **Debian/Ubuntu-based systems** using `apt` package manager. For other Linux distributions, you'll need to manually install the equivalent system packages and then use `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `requirements_cuda.txt` in a virtual environment. The needed system packages are listed in `system_requirements.txt` or `system_requirements_cuda.txt`.

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stefan-Schmidbauer/voicesnip.git
cd voicesnip
```

### 2. Run the Installer

VoiceSnip uses a profile-based installation system. Choose the profile that fits your needs:

```bash
./install.py
```

**Available Profiles:**

| Profile      | Description                                                              | Providers Available                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **basis**    | Whisper Local CPU + Deepgram Cloud transcription                         | Whisper Local CPU, Deepgram Cloud                                         |
| **cuda**     | Local Whisper with GPU support                                           | Whisper Local CPU, Whisper Local GPU, Deepgram Cloud                      |
| **server**   | Faster Whisper Server via remote/network connection                      | Faster Whisper Server, Deepgram Cloud                                     |
| **full**     | All providers: Local Whisper (CPU+GPU) + Faster Whisper Server          | Whisper Local CPU, Whisper Local GPU, Faster Whisper Server, Deepgram    |

**Installation Flow:**

1. The installer shows available profiles
2. You select your preferred profile (basis or cuda)
3. Installer checks system packages - if missing, shows `sudo apt install ...` command
4. Install missing system packages, then re-run installer
5. Installer creates virtual environment and installs Python packages
6. Installation complete!

**Quick Install (Non-Interactive):**

```bash
./install.py --profile basis   # For Deepgram + Whisper CPU
./install.py --profile cuda    # For Deepgram + Whisper CPU/GPU
./install.py --profile server  # For Deepgram + Faster Whisper Server
./install.py --profile full    # For all providers
```

### 3. Configuration

**For Deepgram (Cloud)**: Create a `.env` file for your API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Add your Deepgram API key and adjust the URL if needed:

```bash
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DEEPGRAM_ENDPOINT=https://api.eu.deepgram.com/v1/listen
```

**Note**: The default endpoint uses the EU region (`api.eu.deepgram.com`). For US region, use `https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen`.

**For Faster Whisper Server**: Configure the server endpoint in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Faster Whisper Server Configuration
FASTER_WHISPER_ENDPOINT=http://your-server:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions
# FASTER_WHISPER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # Optional, only if server requires authentication
```

**Note**: The model is configured on the Faster Whisper Server itself (not in VoiceSnip). The server must be running and accessible before using this provider.

### 4. Start VoiceSnip

```bash
./start.sh
```

The application will start with providers available based on your installation profile!

### Switching Profiles

To switch from one profile to another, simply run the installer with the desired profile:

```bash
# Switch from basis to cuda (adds GPU support)
./install.py --profile cuda

# Switch from cuda to basis (keeps existing packages)
./install.py --profile basis
```

By default, the installer reuses the existing virtual environment and adds/updates packages as needed.

If you want to rebuild the virtual environment from scratch (clean install):

```bash
./install.py --profile cuda --rebuild-venv
```

**Note**: Rebuilding is rarely necessary. Use it only if you encounter issues with the installation.

## Usage

### Start Application

**Recommended**: Use the provided shell script:

```bash
./start.sh
```

### How to Use

1. **Select Microphone**: Choose your input device from the dropdown
2. **Select Provider**: Choose between:
   - **Whisper Local CPU** - Free, works everywhere
   - **Whisper Local GPU** - Free, much faster with NVIDIA GPU! 🚀
   - **Faster Whisper Server** - Network/remote server access
   - **Deepgram Cloud** - Requires API key, fastest setup
3. **Select Model**: Choose model size (auto-populated based on provider)
4. **Select Language**: Choose German, English, or Auto-Detection
5. **Configure Hotkey** (Optional):
   - Click the "Record" button next to the hotkey field
   - Press your desired key combination (e.g., Ctrl+Space (default), Alt+R)
   - The hotkey will be automatically detected and saved
6. **Start**: Click "Start" button
   - **First time with Whisper**: Model will download automatically
   - **Be patient!** Large models are several GB and take time to download (see sizes below)
   - Downloads happen only once, then cached locally
   - **Your settings are automatically saved** - next time you start the app, your last used Provider, Model, Language, Microphone, and Hotkey will be pre-selected!
7. **Record**: Hold your configured hotkey and speak
8. **Transcribe**: Release the hotkey - text will be automatically inserted
9. **Stop**: Click "Stop" button when done

### Whisper Model Selection

Available models are predefined in the application:

| Model        | Download Size | GPU VRAM | Comment                 |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| **tiny**     | ~78 MB        | ~230 MB  |                         |
| **base**     | ~149 MB       | ~330 MB  |                         |
| **small**    | ~488 MB       | ~745 MB  | **Recommended for CPU** |
| **medium**   | ~1.5 GB       | ~2 GB    |                         |
| **turbo**    | ~1.6 GB       | ~2.2 GB  | **Recommended for GPU** |
| **large-v3** | ~3.1 GB       | ~3.9 GB  |                         |

**Important Notes:**

- **Download Size**: One-time download from Hugging Face on first use
- **GPU VRAM**: Memory usage measured on RTX 4050 laptop GPU (only relevant when using GPU provider)
- The model is automatically unloaded from VRAM when you click "Stop" or "Quit"

## File Locations

VoiceSnip creates and uses the following files and directories:

### Configuration Files

**In installation directory:**

- **`.env`**: Contains API keys and endpoint configuration (Deepgram, Faster Whisper Server)

**In `~/.config/voicesnip/`:**

- **`config.json`**: Stores your GUI settings (provider, model, language, microphone, hotkey, window dimension)
